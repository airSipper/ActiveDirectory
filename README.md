 ### For this project we were tasked with
 
- connecting two sites with a Cisco site-to-site IPsec VPN 
- configuring dynamic routing (EIGRP) through the VPN tunnel
- configure inter-VLAN routing at each site
- configure AAA for our networking devices
- build and configure a multi-site Active Directory Domain on top of the network infrastructure


After spending some time rebuilding an Active Directory environment on another project, I'd vowed to get some scripts together to help rebuild my next project should the need arise.

The domain's user base for this project was quite small at only around 560 users. I broke down the numbers for what I thought

#### users.py
