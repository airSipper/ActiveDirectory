 ### a collection of scripts used in a recent Networking project I was working on.
 
This project contained the following elements:
- to connect two sites with a Cisco site-to-site VPN
- configure dynamic routing (EIGRP) through the VPN tunnel
- configure inter-VLAN routing at each site
- configure AAA for our networking devices
- build and configure a multi-site Active Directory Domain on top of the network infrastructure
